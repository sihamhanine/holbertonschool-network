Write a detailed blog post covering the following steps that happen when you type "https://www.google.com" in a browser:

DNS Request:
When you enter the URL, your browser sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name into an IP address. Explain how DNS servers work, and how the domain is mapped to the IP address of the server.

TCP/IP:
Once the IP address is found, the browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). Mention the role of IP in finding the destination and TCP in establishing the connection.

Firewall:
Discuss the role of firewalls in filtering traffic and ensuring only valid and allowed traffic can pass through to the server.

HTTPS/SSL:
Explain how the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) works to encrypt the connection, providing data security. Include the HTTPS handshake process (certificate exchange, key generation).

Load Balancer:
A load balancer distributes the incoming requests across multiple servers to handle traffic efficiently. Briefly describe how it works.

Web Server:
The web server (e.g., Nginx) receives the request and passes it on to the application server or sends a static response.

Application Server:
The application server processes dynamic requests, possibly running scripts and code.

Database:
If needed, the application server queries the database for the required information, which it then uses to generate the web page.
